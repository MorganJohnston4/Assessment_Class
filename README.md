# Assessment_Class

This repository contains rmarkdown files for xaringan presentations for Kiva Oken's lectures in the 2023 Stock Assessment Modeling course taught at UW SAFS by NWFSC scientists.

It also contains:
* *Lightly* edited [NMFS xaringan template](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/xaringan-nmfs)
* The presentations knitted to html
* Code extracted from the presentations using `knitr::purl`. 
* Code produced by other instructors that seems useful to have on github where it can be previewed (vs. Google Drive). I will try my best to upload all code here but no guarantees!

The full set of course materials from all instructors (including myself) is available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sK4a79_XNZimsKqhzGyVG9ddxwERiCxb). Please contact me if you need access.
